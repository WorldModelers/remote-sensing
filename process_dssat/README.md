This directory contains a script to append ADMIN level metadata onto DSSAT.

To do so run through the steps contained in the JUPYTER notebook and modify the following parameters:
- PATH_TO_CSV_CONTAINING_LAT_LONG_COORDINATES
  - A CSV file with LATITUDE as the first column and longitude as the second column
- PATH_TO_GADM_SHAPE_FILE
  - See https://gadm.org/download_country_v3.html for available shape files
- OUTPUT_FILE_PATH
